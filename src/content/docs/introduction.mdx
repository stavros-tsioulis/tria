## Overview
TRIA (Templatable Rich Internet Applications) is a web specification that aims to achieve composability of HTML responses for dynamic content, enabling zero-latency page navigations on a Multi-Page Application, as well as providing network benefits by not requiring to download unnecessary assets when navigating across dynamic pages.

## The problem
Let's suppose a website has a dynamic page where each user can view their own profile. For example, the paths for those subpages would be `/user/1`, `/user/2`, [...].

These pages are dynamic, meaning that their content is constructed based on some *metadata*. In the context of users, that metadata could be the user's username; their display name; their bio; their date of birth; etc.. Save for the aforementioned, the pages `/user/1` and `/user/2` usually have no other differences. Therefore, it becomes a necessity to compose a *page template* out of themâ€”one that works given any metadata that share a structure, for the purpose of eliminating code duplication, and in some cases to save on a user's network bandwidth.

## The proposal
TRIA proposes a standard for providing template-building instructions, such that clients can generate dynamic pages by requiring only the metadata that is required to render the page.

These instructions lay inside HTML elements with the `tria-` prefix, followed by a declaration. Its value may be empty or a string, depending on the declaration.

## Example
Below is an example HTML response that satisfies the TRIA standard:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1 tria-content="greetingMessage" tria-attr="title:greetingMessage" title="Hi, Mary.">Hi, Mary.</h1>
      <p>Here is a list of today's tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li tria-list-item="item:tasks.items" tria-content="item.title">Finalize acquisition draft.</li>
        <li tria-list-item="item:tasks.items" tria-content="item.title">Examine applicants' tests.</li>
        <li tria-list-item="item:tasks.items" tria-content="item.title">Create sprint tickets for all teams.</li>
      </ul>
      <button tria-if="nonempty(tasks.items)">Clear all</button>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

Given the above HTML, the client can now generate that page with any metadata of the following form:

```json
{
  "greetingMessage": "Hi, Mary.",
  "tasks": {
    "items": [
      {
        "title": "Finalize acquisition draft."
      },
      {
        "title": "Examine applicants' tests."
      },
      {
        "title": "Create sprint tickets for all teams."
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

## How it works
Under the hood, when HTML is received by the client, it transforms the response into a template that can be used to reproduce the input HTML by providing the appropriate metadata. This template can be of any shape. TRIA does not concern itself with the underlying implementation, and is compatible with most templating engines to act as intermediaries.

For example, a transformation with a custom language would look like:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      {
        set (0.content, metadata.greetingMessage)
        set (0.attr:title, metadata.greedingMessage)
        <h1></h1>
      }
      <p>Here is a list of today's tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        {
          for (item of metdata.tasks.items)
          {
            set (0.content, item.title)
            <li></li>
          }
        }
      </ul>
      {
        if (nonempty(metadata.tasks.items))
        <button>Clear all</button>
      }
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here's the same, but in JSX:

```jsx
<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1 title={metadata.greetingMessage}>{metadata.greetingMessage}</h1>
      <p>Here is a list of today's tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        {metadata.tasks.items.map(item => (
          <li>{item.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      {metadata.tasks.length > 0 && (
        <button>Clear all</button>
      )}
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

## TRIA's purpose
TRIA defines a set of rules that must be satisfied in order for the HTML to be able to be transformed into a template of any language. That template could be JSX, EJS, Pug, Handlebars, or even a completely custom one.
